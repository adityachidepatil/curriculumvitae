            <h6>RESEARCH INTEREST</h6>
            In today’s world, the pressing challenge of climate change and environmental degradation
            demands innovative solutions that balance economic progress with ecological sustainability.
            Industries face increasing pressure to minimize carbon footprints, policymakers struggle to
            design effective incentives for green transitions, and consumers lack the tools to make
            sustainable choices. Addressing these interconnected issues requires the integration of
            advanced computational tools with environmental science to optimize processes, reduce
            emissions, and drive a sustainable future. My research vision focuses on harnessing
            computer science to address these critical challenges. By pursuing this research, I aim to
            revolutionize environmental science and product design through scalable, API-powered
            solutions. This vision not only addresses the immediate need for sustainability in
            industries and energy but also equips policymakers and consumers with the tools to
            drive meaningful, data-backed change. My goal is to create a digital framework that bridges
            science, technology, and society, bringing about the much-needed transformation to combat
            climate change and build a more sustainable future.
